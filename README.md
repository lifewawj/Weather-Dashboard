# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

A web application that fetches current weather data and a 5-day forecast for a specific city using the OpenWeatherMap API [here](https://openweathermap.org/api) .

### Personal Insight

As someone who enjoys outdoor activities and travel, I created this application to streamline the process of checking weather conditions. Whether planning a hiking trip, a day at the beach, or any outdoor adventure, having accurate and timely weather information is crucial. This web app serves as a convenient tool to ensure that plans align with the current and upcoming weather forecast.

### What I've Learned

- Leveraging Web APIs: I discovered how to fetch data from a Web API, allowing me to access real-time weather information.
- Chaining API Calls: By using the data obtained from one API call, I learned how to construct subsequent calls with dynamic parameters, enhancing the depth and specificity of the information retrieved.
- Data Manipulation: Extracting and manipulating specific parts of the data, such as splitting and grabbing relevant information, became a valuable skill in tailoring the user experience.
